      Hello, my name is Connor Mattson

          <p>
          I grew up watching Sci-Fi shows like Stargate and Firefly, but rather than falling in love with the gun-wielding heroes I found myself more and more interested in the scientists and engineers behind the scenes. Combine this with an upbringing surrounded in computers and by the time I started high school I knew what kind of career I wanted.<br/>
          In 2013, when I was 15, the Edward Snowden leaks began. Politics aside, this was my first exposure to cyber secuity beyond movies such as WarGames or Hackers. This developed into a burning curiosity about how systems were compromised and the question of: could a system ever be secure?<br/>
          My cyber security education began with the Cisco Networking Academy in 2014 where I learnt about what drives networks and the basic devices used to control and protect them. In 2016, my final year of high school, my computer science teacher tasked students in our class with "making a prototype for something interesting" as a year-long project for our portfolio. My project was the prototype of an end-to-end encrypted messaging app; it was ugly as hell with a barebones interface, but it was functional (on Windows) and secure.<br/>
          Now that I'm at university and working towards my degrees, I have a lot less freedom in the projects I can do for assessments. Nevertheless, I continue to code and learn in my free time. I hope to one day work in the security engineering industry and have developed an interest in the application of artificial intelligence in this field.
