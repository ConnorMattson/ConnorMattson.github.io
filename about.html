          <p>
            I am a final year student studying a BE(Hons) in Engineering Science / BSc in Computer Science at the University of Auckland. I am interested in Software Development, Data Science, Operations Research, and financial applications of mathematics/computing such as Quantitative Analysis.<br><br>
            Computers were introduced to me as a tool for people to use to make their lives easier. Looking into how computers do this, I began to search for other ways to simplify tasks. Eventually this led me to Engineering Science, a degree that focuses on developing mathematical models to minimise costs, maximise efficiency, and simulate outcomes to make the best possible decision.

            <li><b>2018 - present: Software Engineer Intern at Rocket Lab Limited</b><br>
              What started as a fixed term internship at Rocket Lab quickly became a permanent role working part-time during university semesters and full-time during breaks. I work closely with both the Production and Avionics teams in developing Python applications as well as contributing to embedded firmware written in C. I was the lead developer on projects that have:
              <ul>
                <li>Been deployed throughout the company both in New Zealand and The United States</li>
                <li>Significantly reduced production time and cost – in several cases I investigated inefficiencies and proposed these projects myself, leading to savings of over 90% in both metrics</li>
                <li>Aided in certification and qualification by NASA</li>
              </ul>
            </li><br>

            <li><b>2019 - present: Head of Engineering at Koios</b><br>
              Koios is a team within the Auckland Programme for Space Systems; our aim is to increase interest in STEM at university by engaging students at a high school level using New Zealand built satellites. During weekends when I was not working or studying, I am leading the design and development of a 1U CubeSat and associated ground infrastructure. I specifically worked on the following aspects:
              <ul>
                <li>Systems architecture, Project management, and leadership of several engineers</li>
                <li>Scheduling of communications windows for optimal power and bandwidth usage</li>
                <li>On-board computer and payload computer firmware, embedded systems programming</li>
                <li>Orbit simulation and analysis in MATLAB and Python</li>
                <li>Ground station control software Python and C</li>
                <li>Database access through a REST API and website – Javascript, HTML, and CSS</li>
              </ul>
            </li><br>

            <li><b>2017 - 2018: Freelance digital design and development</b></li>
            <li><b>2017: Part-time teacher aide for Computer Science as well as Animation and Motion Graphics at Saint Kentigern College</li>
