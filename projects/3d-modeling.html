3D Modeling and Animation

During my time in high-school I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to study animation and motion graphics. It turned out to be something I really enjoy and continue to play around with when I have time.<br><br>
During my final year, I spent 8 months working on a character design project. I had the opportunity to be taught advanced 3D modeling and sculpting techniques one-on-one by a motion editor from Weta Digital and chose to fully develop a model of my character for the project.<br><br>
After several iterations and pages of feedback from Weta Digital and AUT's digital design department, my model was complete and ready to exhibit. The next two months of the year were spent on exhibition design and execution.<br><br>
For my exhibition, I transformed a room into a small forest. Placing murals on the walls as well as covering the floor in a layer of dirt, bark, and twigs. Plinths and tables throughout the room featured 3D-printed versions of the model, prints of the model composited into different photographs were placed around the room, and a TV was placed along one wall playing a video of the entire development process for the model.<br><br>
The final month of my time at school was spent developing a showreel, linked below.
