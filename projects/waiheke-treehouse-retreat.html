Waiheke Treehouse Retreat
</section>

<section class="modal-body">
The Waiheke Island Treehouse Retreat project features two accommodation pods nested in the tree canopy, connected with boardwalks, and a third pod sitting lower in the valley. The section falls away from road level steeply, making the third pod roughly seven metres above ground level.<br><br>

The project directors were interested in a 3D model - produced from the existing technical drawings - giving a realistic representation of the site for reports and marketing.
