The University of Auckland Computer Sciencenetwork lab hosts the Auckland Satellite Simulator
<a href="http://sde.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/">(http://sde.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/)</a>. It is used to simulate Internet traffic to small Pacific
islands that are connected to the rest of the world via a satellite link.<br><br>

On the island side of the satellite link, the simulator eavesdrops on the incoming
packets. It stores summary information about each packet in a trace file. The
trace file is plain text and each line contains the record for exactly one packet.<br><br>

Trace File Viewer gets a graphical display of how much data
comes from a particular source host over time, or how much data goes to a
particular destination host over the course of an experiment.
