Greedy walks in pursuit of laziness

This is my submission for the 2017 ENGGEN 131 MATLAB project at The University of Auckland.<br><br>

"This project requires you to write code that will allow you to find the best path from one side of a map to the other, where the map is represented as 
a 2D array containing elevation data. For our purposes the best path is deemed to be the one where a person moving from the west side of the map to the 
east (or vice versa) would experience the smallest total change in elevation as they move along that path (where any increase or decrease in elevation 
is interpreted as a positive change)."<br><br>

Although the assignment was fairly basic, I really enjoyed the final stage of optimising functions to get extra marks for speed.<br>
Functions had to run in under 10 seconds in order to earn maximum marks. My greedy and non-greedy functions ran in 0.25 and 0.005 seconds on average
respectively - the fastest in our year.
