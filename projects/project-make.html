"Learning to design is a complex activity requiring the collective knowledge and practices of the design community across all sectors and disciplines.<br>
Project Make champions the role of design and design education in New Zealand and encourages folk to make things together.<br><br>

We make things<br>
We strive to make things well<br>
We aspire to make things that matter<br><br>

Ultimately, we want to make a difference. Together."<br><br>

In addition to collaborating with Project Make on several of their initial events. I assisted Demelza Round, founder and director, in establishing sensible protocols and workflows for working with collaborators, students, educators, and industry experts.
